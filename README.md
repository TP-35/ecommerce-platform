# How to fork projects and push changes
- [Fork Projects and Push Changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lGpZkjnkt4&ab_channel=Fireship)
  - Don't forget to create your own branch named after the feature you're developing.
  - An example branch format might be: `Name/feature-1` | `Bob/home-page-impl`
- Changes should be made (via Pull Requests) to the main repository. 
  - If two or more people want to collaborate on a feature
    - Create a separate branch and push changes to that branch first.
    - *OR* Use a branch from the local fork of one of the collaborators.
- Pull Requests should follow the PR template, but feel free to remove/add parts.
- Pull Requests to the main repository must be reviewed before being merged.
